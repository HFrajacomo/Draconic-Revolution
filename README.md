# Draconic Revolution
Draconic Revolution is a procedural voxel-based sandbox online RPG currently in development. This game was inspired in my very own Homebrew table RPG System, created in 2016 and played by multiple parties up until today. This game is meant to be a digital version that fully implements all core mechanics and the main campaign of the system. Draconic Revolution was made using the Unity Engine.
